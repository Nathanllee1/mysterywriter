      "[\"He was used to seeing some unusual things in his travels. Different cultures, different ways of doing things. However, the day he was walking in the park and saw a woman hanging by a strip of fabric upside down in a tree, he was sure he had entered another dimension and not just another continent. He approached her slowly, as she swung and stretched. He didn't wish to alarm her. Finally, she turned her eyes towards him and smiled. He almost took a step back. Her eyes were grey, like the stormiest night he had ever seen. This was very different than the way it was in Japan.\", '\"I beg your pardon, but what are you doing?\" he asked her, his accent heavy but his words clear. She tilted her head, as though she didn\\'t understand. Or perhaps she didn\\'t understand why he was asking.', '\"Dancing.\" She replied, gracefully untangling herself from the fabric and landing softly on her very small feet. He raised his eyebrows, his eyes hidden behind a slight glare on his eyeglasses. That was unlike any sort of dancing he had ever seen before. But again, different country, different way to do things. It took all of himself not to take a step back when she asked him in fluent Japanese if he was Mr. Otsuka. He cleared his throat and nodded his head. She carried on in Japanese, as though it was second nature to her.', '\"I\\'m Alex. Alexandria Flores.\" Ah. So she was the one he was needing to meet with. He had unwittingly assumed that Alex Flores was a male. He was definitely out of his comfort zone. Now looking at the slip of a woman that stood before him, in a tank top and sweatpants with her feet bare, he wished he could have been right about his assumptions. He held up his briefcase.', '\"You\\'re the investor?\"', '\"I am.\" She had switched back to English, which he assumed was more comfortable for her. That was fine. Since he knew she could understand him, he would carry on in his native tongue. Especially since she already made him feel so uncomfortable.', '\"Before I sign the document, can you just tell me why you bought out my partner?\"', '\"I can.\" She answered, maintaining a strong amount of eye contact. \"After you sign the papers.\"', '\"Fine.\" He didn\\'t truly care why she bought him out. Tanaka was a horrid man, played dirty and made his clients miserable. He was only partner because of how much financially he put into the company. No matter what the reasoning it was a blessing that he was gone.', \"She made her way over to a bench and sat down, gesturing for him to take a seat next to her. He did so. She wordlessly waited patiently while he pulled paperwork out of his briefcase, handing her the documents that he needed her to sign. She pulled her pen out of some pocket, though he couldn't have been sure which one, and signed the documents he handed her. He was sure she was at least partially crazy. He could be stealing her shares of the company and she wouldn't have even been partially aware with how little she was reading the documents. He was grateful for her sake he was an honest man. She handed him back the last document and he skimmed through them, nodding his head. Finally, he put them back in the briefcase.\", '\"That\\'s all, then. Congratulations.\"', '\"Actually, there\\'s one more document that needs attention.\" She told him, standing to her feet. He looked about her, but couldn\\'t see or even think of anywhere she could be keeping any sort of file. He was shocked when she took a running start at that tree, leaping into the air and clinging to that ribbon. He watched in a combination of shock and awe as she climbed her way to the top of the ribbon, pulling a file out from a hiding spot among a tangle of branches. He almost barked out a laugh. Such a strange little woman. He did step forward against his own accord when she wrapped herself up in that ribbon and let go, tumbling in an almost graceful manner down to the ground, landing on her feet. He let out a breath he didn\\'t even know he was holding as she stepped forward and handed him the file. He took it, skimming through it as quickly as he could. It was a bill of sale. For her shares of his company. And the selling price was…this couldn\\'t be right. He scanned it again, then scanned the accompanying page which was written in Japanese. Sure enough. It was being given to him. She was charging him no fees, nothing. It was even signed by her. All he had to do was sign it.', '\"Why?\" he finally managed to choke out the question, so many emotions getting the better of him.', '\"Because I don\\'t need it.\" She answered with a casual shrug.', '\"Then you could simply give me power of attorney. I don\\'t accept that answer. Tell me the truth.\" He began speaking to her in harsh English, hoping it would jar her enough to give him a truthful answer. With another casual shrug, she tried again.', '\"Someone told me you needed your company back.\"', '\"Back? Someone? You\\'re making no sense.\" He answered, his heartbeat sounding in his ears. She smiled, and in a gesture that made his spine stiffen she reached out and wrapped her arms around him in a friendly hug.', '\"You have friends looking out for you, Mr. Otsuka.\" She said, waiting until he reached up and started returning her hug before she pulled back, the file still in his hands. He closed his eyes, putting his emotions back in check. \"Don\\'t be afraid any longer.\" He opened his eyes to ask her what she meant, but she was gone. And that ribbon that she was dancing from was blowing in the wind. She was gone. Later that week, as he walked back into his office in Japan he would search for her contact information again, finding nothing but dead ends. She entered his life as a mystery. And left just as much of an enigma as she came. But if he said nothing else about the woman, he would forever say this: he never forgot her.', \"The first book of the series - 'Sharpe's Mysterious Enterprises'\", \"Rose's Mystery Cruise\", \"A very tall, dark building stood towering over one girl, who was staring up, an arm shielding her face; The moonlight was reflecting off the blackout windows that surrounded this 10 storey structure. In the centre, thick bold letters spelt out 'SHARPE ENTERPRISES'.\", 'This girl stood alone in the empty courtyard wearing what looked like a traditional, wedding dress; a long white gown that trailed across the ground behind her. A slight, cool breeze blew around her, making her lift the throw she had on her arms, up onto her bare shoulders.', 'Staring straight ahead at the doorway to this enormous structure which consisted of the same glass window as the rest of the building. The only way you could tell it was the main entrance was by the stairway that leads up to it which looked as if it was made of the same material.', 'After taking her first two steps forward, something firm landed on her left shoulder, halting her from going any further. Turning her head she came face to face with light, blue eyes and short, dark hair. These features belonged to a guy, who stood a few inches taller than the girl, herself.', '\"Are you sure, you are doing the right thing?\" The guy asked, with a concerned look on his face. \"You don\\'t have to go through with this.\"', 'The look of sorrow came over the girl\\'s face before she instantly turned back around. \"We both know, I have to.\" She responded back.', 'Slowly, but surely, the guy lifted his hand from her shoulder. \"I failed...\" He started to say.', 'The girl slowly turned back to face him with a concerned look, of her own.', '\"Failed, as a brother.\" He continued to say, which somehow made his eyes water. Instantly, he turned his face away, in embarrassment; as if suddenly realising he was showing his emotions, like an open book.', 'Her own hand reached out towards him and landed on his forearm before saying, \"Don\\'t you dare say that.\" The girl\\'s face now had that look of determination.', \"Those words alone made him look back up. This time with shock written all over his face; as if he couldn't believe the words that were flowing through his ears.\", '\"I won\\'t listen to such a thing.\" The girl\\'s hand gripped his arm tighter, shaking it a little; as if to get her point across. \"Do you hear me? Do you?\" She demanded, staring back at him.', 'He continued to stare back until a moment later he slowly nodded his head and looked away again.', \"The girl slowly removed her hand but didn't once look away. Not until, she felt a slight vibration, beneath her feet. Instantly, making her look down.\", 'After a moment or two, they both stared back at each other with a sad look on their faces.', '\"I really must go.\" The girl suddenly said as a frightened look appeared on her face; as if she knew that had been some sort of warning.', 'After a small nod from her brother, she turned back towards the entrance and slowly continued walking, taking one step at a time. Before she knew it, her foot knocked against the bottom step and stared down at it, in confusion; as if she had been day-dreaming and just realised where she was.', '\"Be Brave!\" A certain voice echoed around the girl.', 'Instantly, turning back to where she could still see her brother, but now there was a girl standing next to him; with short, light blonde hair. This girl raised her hand into the air; as if she was signalling hello or more likely goodbye. Then another girl appeared on the other side of her brother; this girl had long, dark hair. But she just stood there like a statue; as if not sure what to say or do. The girl who stood to stare at the three of them, returned the same hand signal, before turning back around again.', 'As soon as she did, the girl found another guy waiting at the top of the stairs, with his back to her. A small smile slowly appeared on her face which started to bring more colour to her cheeks. Instantly, her feet started moving up the steps, more quickly. Just before she reached the top, the guy started turning around where there was a bright smile of his own. The girl reached the top and the guy took her hands into his and pulled her closer.', '\"Nearly... We nearly managed to do it,\" he spoke slowly while resting his forehead against hers.', '\"Maybe, next time,\" The girl responded back.', 'Their lips made contact. \"I\\'ll be waiting!\" He whispered into her mouth.', \"Instantly, the girl's hand reached up and the moment it landed on the side of his neck, he wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her right up against him. Her hand moved, around to the back of his neck as they both started kissing more passionately.\", 'It started with a distant clapping floating around the two of them that seemed to get louder and louder as if it was getting closer and closer until there was a mighty bang. The girl felt herself flying backwards, out of his arms altogether; it was if a powerful gust of wind had sent her soaring through the air. That was until she felt the sudden impact against the back of her head, then feeling herself sliding down till her bum landed, quite hard on a solid surface.', 'The girl seemed to be having trouble opening her eyes; as if it was quite painful to do. The moment she managed to see out of them, she found herself inside the building itself, staring back towards the main door which was slowly sliding closed.', '\"Our love will continue to fight this.\"', 'Was the last thing the girl heard before the door closed completely and she lost consciousness, altogether', 'La Carta.', 'Ernesto contempló con curiosidad la carta que le llegó por correo. El remitente era un antiguo amor que él tuvo hacía mucho tiempo atrás, una mujer a la que amó con todo su corazón y cuyo recuerdo permanecía fresco en su memoria a pesar de los años. La misiva fue enviada dos días antes, de acuerdo a la fecha que puso la oficina postal desde donde se mandó, y en ella esa mujer le expresaba a Ernesto su deseo de volverlo a ver.', '\"Cuando el reloj de tu abuelo marque las tres en punto, estaré esperándote en el banco junto al viejo olmo del parquecito que está ubicado frente a tu casa\", decía esa mujer, con la pulcra letra que siempre la caracterizó y que Ernesto recordaba muy bien. \"Estaré contando los minutos en mi reloj porque ardo en deseos de ver tu rostro\".', 'Lo que más le sorprendió no fue el hecho de que la mujer no podía saber en dónde vivía, pues Ernesto dejó de verla desde antes de que se mudara ahí, ni tampoco que conociera que frente a su casa hay un parquecito con un viejo olmo. O que estuviera enterada de que su abuelo le heredó su antiquísimo reloj cinco años antes. No, lo que más le asombró a Ernesto fue la cuestión de que esa mujer a la que tanto amó, su misteriosa remitente, llevaba muerta diez años, él estuvo presente en el velorio y vio su cuerpo inerte en el ataúd.', 'Down the Rabbit Hole', 'Drip... Drip... Drip...', \"The dark liquid is dripping off the rim of his helmet. Whose helmet? Don't know. Where is he? Not sure. If anything, probably in No Man's Land. A place where bodies can go to lie still on the ground; a haven where souls can finally break free of this everlasting hell; a trashcan in which a boy throws out all of his sister's fragmented Dutch dolls. Whether it be a mindless act of revenge or an attempt to drive the agitating boredom out of his childish mind, the damages are irreversible. Now, the toys are way too broken. Completely unfixable. Within these foggy trenches, it's hard to spot a man in need; it's hard to find anything when you can't even find yourself. As the helmet counts off the man's last breaths, I sit on the soggy ground, thinking. Thinking about where that kid with his dreams had gone. Thinking about where he had gotten lost. Thinking. Next to me, the helmet slows down its counting. Almost dead. Soon, like frail branches in a fireplace, the fierce flamethrowers will devour the man's body, or maybe, the avid artillery will instead sink onto and snap him into bits and pieces. Simply child's play. What even is flesh to metal? Oh, my my, speak of the devil. Here come some more wild wasps.\", 'Tick... Tick... Tick...', \"My head won't stop ticking! These roaring booms and bangs keep stinging my head, my sanity. Oh Lord, I beg you, get them out. Out, away I say, you fiends! Shh, no matter, no matter Georgie. Remember what your papa said? To fight, to fight with the American pride that's within you. Yes(!), that beautiful, shining American pride. Armor that when worn shields you from any lingering fear. Yet, right now, I can't find any of it. I am searching and searching but finding nothing. Nothing but a hollow me. I feel like an empty treasure chest, void of any gold coins. To what value am I even worth now if I have no reason to fight? If I have no reason to hand over my life? These pirates have no use of me no more. Pirates who have promised me money and satisfaction for my duty but have instead stole from me my friends, my family, my future. Now that I'll die here, it'll all be gone. Gone and out of my grasp. Gone and in their hands.\", 'Clink... Clink... Clink... ', \"The rifleman halts his desperate firing to drop more bullets into his weapon; halts to drop some more pain into this murderous machine. Pain for them; pain for him; pain for all involved in this. No man on this or that side has ever wished to kill. Well, no human at least. Here, we're only doing what we're being forced to. Not I or this rifleman or the nearly dead man on the field have ever wanted to take a life. Never. To take a life is to take a father from a child or a child from a father. The few that do savor such barbarity are nothing but animals. Wicked, vicious, immoral animals. Blood hungry beasts that must've never felt pure love. For if they truly had, then they would've known. They would've known that there are loved ones nervously waiting for the man that they've just ripped to shreds; they would've known the heart crush of hearing the messenger bang on the door; they would've known the pain that surpasses that of any bullet. They would've known. O, how dreadful be the banging doors... banging! There's banging everywhere! Banging and shouting and crying and fighting and… and…\", 'Silence.', 'The blood stops dripping; the rifleman ends his firing; the bombs quit their pounding and the bullets cease their flying. What could this be? Hold on, what\\'s that? The rifleman had muttered something, but I can\\'t hear from all this ticking. \"The enemy is set to charge!\" O no, this is it! My time has finally come. That kid with all his dreams and desires will now be lost forever. Never found. I gradually raise my head over the seeping, muddy wall, expecting to see death, expecting to see slaughter, expecting to see… Alice?! Yes! Indeed, that\\'s Alice jumping out of a burning fighter plane and floating down onto the battlefield. What\\'s this? Tweedledee and Tweedledum on a German tank? Oh my, there\\'s the Knave of Hearts spraying down men with a machine gun. Even the Mad Hatter is here! Though, it is quite difficult to see his face with that gas mask on. No, this can\\'t be happening. How?! I sit down and try to think this over. I try to understand, but I just can\\'t. I just can\\'t comprehend the incomprehensible; I just can\\'t think with all this ticking. I look up and see the White Rabbit staring at me. There he is in a red suit, black bowtie, a ticking gold pocket watch hanging from the top-left pocket, and a square camera in his hands. There he is with a blank rabbit face. A face too expressionless to have experienced any of this. A face way too sane. Honestly, it\\'s kind of funny. It\\'s funny how this unaware soul is meant to portray this catastrophe; funny how unlike everyone else here, he gets to come home all in one piece. Way too funny. Actually, it\\'s so funny that I just can\\'t stop laughing. I can\\'t! I laugh as my helmet starts to tilt from all the bouncing; I laugh as the screaming and killing are occurring nearby; I laugh as he aims the camera at me.

As a matter a fact, this story features someone related to the main antagonist of the Sherlock Holmes story in question.', \"With that being said, this story does not feature any characters originally created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle or any writers of the Sherlock Holmes franchise, because if it did, then this story would've been posted on FanFiction.\", \"Once again, I'll like to emphasize that the Garfield in this story is my character Garfield Wu, NOT his namesake Garfield the cat from the Garfield comic strip created by Jim Davis.\", 'Chapter 1: Prologue and the first calculus lecture', 'September 10, 1971', 'It has been almost a year since Garfield solved the mystery of the Phantom Cadet with the help of several cadet friends during a training night. In the year since then, a lot has happened to him.', 'In the weeks following his submission of university applications, complete with his school grades and the courses he was taking for Grade 12, he received a handful of entrance scholarship offers from the universities he had applied to.', 'One of his scholarship offers was from the University of Ottawa for the Civil Engineering, Mathematics and Geography programs he applied to, while the second scholarship offers was from Carleton University for the Civil Engineering and Geography programs he applied to.', \"It wouldn't be until May that he decided to accept Carleton University's admission offer to the civil engineering program, and then what followed was his spending most of a couple late-June afternoons at the university gym for the course selection.\", \"It was a hassle for Garfield, given that there are plenty of compulsory courses he had to take, but that their timing and scheduling doesn't fit with the elective courses he was interested in taking, nor does it meeting the minimum credit requirements for first year, in addition to the fact that the place was packed with students doing the same thing.\", 'But eventually, Garfield pulled through and managed to make his schedule work. In addition to the compulsory engineering, math and science courses, namely calculus, linear algebra, physics and chemistry, he also elected to take a geography course.', 'After getting through with the paper work, arranging the tuition payments and getting his hands on the textbooks over the late summer, he was all set for university.', 'In the same time period, Garfield got a part-time job working in the local grocery store in the Glebe neighbourhood as a cashier. It was his way for earning extra money, especially as he is to start university studies and needs to pay off the tuition.', 'In the weeks since he got the job, it was becoming more frequent for Garfield to head straight to the grocery store after school on Mondays and Wednesdays, and as the weeks passed by and turned into months, Garfield became more familiar with the job.', 'He got along with his co-workers and the store owner well, and they find him humourous and easy-going.', 'In the meantime, he found himself hanging out more-frequently with Rahman, Anita and sometimes with their friend Jamie Larson, all of whom shared excellent dynamics with him.', 'He will frequently hang around with them after school before heading to work, and they will at times share jokes or discuss homework.', 'In fact, Garfield found himself interacting with Anita frequently when it comes to working on their chemistry labs and assignments, and they will often discuss with each other about how the report should be typed up.', \"He will also never forget the particular day that past December when their chemistry class got cancelled due to the teacher calling in sick and the school wasn't able to find a substitute teacher in time.\", 'With their friends Jordan Horner and his group deciding to go elsewhere to chill, Garfield found himself with Anita as they decided to hang out in the cafeteria.', 'The two friends sat across the table from each other in the otherwise largely-deserted cafeteria, and they decided to pass the time through some idle chatting and reading through their class notes.', 'As Garfield took out a pen and started drawing buses and trains on some older note pages, Anita watched him drawing before deciding to ask him something.', '\"Oh Garfield, just a bit of curiosity.\" She said, and Garfield paused his drawing before looking up.', '\"Ah, yes?\" Garfield asked, noting the smile on her face.', '\"What type of music do you normally listen to?\" Anita asked.', '\"Classical music.\" Garfield replied with a small smile.', '\"Ah, I see.\" Anita smiled, and in that instant, some feelings began tugging Garfield\\'s heartstrings as he noted the smile on Anita\\'s face.', 'He smiled back at her before they resumed whatever they were doing.', 'Looking back at that moment, Garfield certainly felt like he and Anita were on a date of sorts.', 'Later that afternoon after school, when Rahman and Anita decided to do some dance practicing, the former took out a gramophone and placed it on the nearby public gramophone player.', 'With the needle on the disk, the couple prepared for the dance practice.', \"As the gramophone player started playing the opening A major note of Johann Strauss, Jr.'s Blue Danube Waltz, Garfield immediately recognized the music.\", '\"The Blue Danube Waltz.\" He said.', 'At the remark, Rahman turned to him with a smile.', '\"Ah, that\\'s really good, Garfield.\" Rahman praised. \"Being able to recognize the music right as it began.\"', '\"Garfield told me that he listens to classical music.\" Anita said to him.', '\"I see.\" Rahman nodded. \"You sure got good musical tastes, Garfield.\"', 'Garfield simply nodded at the remark.', 'As a matter a fact, he felt that Rahman was becoming more like a brother to him particularly with their dynamic whenever they interact with each other.', 'He also remembered the time Rahman spotted him at Billings Bridge one Saturday while he was checking on the cadets doing poppy distribution for the Royal Canadian Legion in uniform, where he then encouraged Rahman to donate to one of the cadets when Rahman expressed interest in getting a poppy for himself and Anita.', \"Anyways, about a week after that December day with the cancelled chemistry class, Garfield was invited to Rahman's birthday party by Jamie, an invitation he happily accepted, especially since Rahman's birthday fell on a Monday but for that particular Monday, he wasn't scheduled to go to work.\", 'So off they went after school, Garfield sandwiched between Rahman and Anita at the front and Jamie and her then-boyfriend Gerald.', 'At one point, while walking on Holmwood Avenue towards Bank Street, Jamie noticed something and said something to Rahman and Anita before saying \"Never mind.\"', '\"He\\'s right here.\" Rahman said.', '\"Who\\'s right here?\" Garfield asked as he arched his eyebrows, having been deep in thought during the conversation.', '\"Oh, we were talking about you, Garfield.\" Rahman said. \"Jamie saw that guy with the red coat over there and thought you went far ahead of us.\"', 'Garfield looked ahead and spotted the person in question before nodding.', '\"Oh, I see.\" He said, noting the fact that he, too, was wearing a red coat. \"If I was really that far ahead, when I reach Bank Street and saw that you guys weren\\'t here, I\\'m gonna be like \\'Hey, where are you guys at?\\' or \\'Did I lose you guys?\\'\"', '\"Oh yeah, you\\'re probably going to be like \\'Oh no, I\\'m lost!\\'\" Rahman said, and they all joined him in laughing.', 'Garfield will also never forget the last day of school before the Christmas break, where it snowed a lot the whole day and the school was pretty much half-full the day.', \"Anyways, after school, he hung around with Rahman and Anita, entertaining them with his violin-playing until it was like almost 17:00 and with the school hallway deserted and his rendering of Vivaldi's A minor Violin Concerto, the area certainly looked spooked and haunted, something which Rahman noticed as Garfield was almost finished with the final movement.\", 'They eventually found themselves discussing ghost stories, such as one taking place in a haunted school with a group finding themselves locked in it.', 'It was then that Garfield realized that part of the reason why he felt he shares great dynamic with Rahman and Anita and Jamie is because of their finding common ground in story-telling.', 'When he turned 17 this past June, Garfield took the liberty of inviting Rahman and Anita to his home for a birthday party.', 'Anita will eventually asked him if Jamie can join them, and Garfield agreed, especially after Jamie helped him with his Grade 12 Tech. Design project where he was struggling to finish his model dream room.', \"On their last day of high school before graduation and summer, the four hung out together and went to the bakery on Bank Street where they've celebrated Rahman's birthday six months earlier.\", 'During that time, Rahman told Garfield about the time early in Grade 10 when during lunch period, he will walk through the cafeteria.', '\"And then, I look around and saw you sitting all by yourself in the cafeteria and was like, \\'Man, that guy sure is lonely.\\'\" Rahman said to Garfield.', '\"Ah, I see.\" Garfield nodded before thinking to himself, \"That was back when I was new to Glebe, having had transferred from Hillcrest High.\"', '\"Later, I was talking to Jordan the other day and he was like, \\'Yo, Garfield\\'s been getting all the girls\\' attention, especially since he solved that mystery regarding those string of thefts and uncovered the key to Bruce Stevenson\\'s last will.\\'\" Rahman continued. \"And I was like, \\'Who\\'s Garfield?\\' It was only when I walked through the cafeteria and saw you seated at your usual spot that I realize who you were.\"', \"At the remark, Garfield arched his eyebrows, caught off-guard by how Rahman was able to deduce his name, as well as the fact that he had managed to attract Rahman's attention way back in Grade 10.\", \"But then again, he figured that he shouldn't be surprised, because after all, Rahman and Anita already attracted his attention on his first day in Glebe.\", 'Anyways, on his 17th birthday, Garfield had a lot of fun with Rahman, Anita and Jamie as they hung out together and had lunch.', 'They enjoyed their lunch and snack at a restaurant where they also can play board games and cards, and they had a great time playing cards.', \"One thing to note was that all of this was a day before he, his brother Dave, sisters Emma and Diana and their mother Melissa were due to fly to Melbourne, Australia for one of his aunts' wedding.\", 'From her family, Melissa is the oldest of three daughters though she is the middle child.', 'Her second-youngest sister Janet is the one that is getting married a few days after his 17th birthday, and Melissa decided to make the occasion to fly to Melbourne with the siblings performing in the wedding party.', \"Her youngest sister Rebecca had already gotten married eight years back and is the mother of two girls. Like Janet, Rebecca currently lives in Melbourne with her family and it's been a long while since Garfield last saw them.\", \"Needless to say, the trip to Australia was a lot of fun, in spite of the fact that it's winter over there while it's summer in Canada.\", 'It also came before David and the sisters were due to head for cadet summer camp and Garfield taking part in international air cadet exchange in early July, so they actually only got to stay in Australia for ten days.', 'For the summer, David was accepted to aerodrome operations & management camp, which takes place over at RCAF Station North Bay, located a two-hour train ride away from Ottawa.', 'Several hours after returning to Ottawa and catching up with some sleep, David took off with his pre-packed belongings for Ottawa Union Station to meet up with the travel committee also heading for North Bay, whereupon they took the scheduled CN Rail passenger train bound for North Bay.', 'In the meantime, Emma was accepted to advanced aviation camp, which takes place over at RCAF Station Greenwood with travel requiring first a train-ride to Montreal followed by a flight to Halifax and then a bus ride to Greenwood.', 'Diana was accepted to advanced leadership and drill instructor camp, which takes place over at RCAF Station Bagotville with travel also requiring first a train-ride to Montreal. After arriving at Montreal, she and the cadets heading for Bagotville are transferred to another train that continues on to Bagotville with major stops at Trois Rivieres and Quebec City along the way.', \"As for Garfield's international air cadet exchange, he ended up on a two-week trip to Japan with a few other cadets from other parts of the country, and he fully enjoyed the trip, particularly with the meeting with their Japanese counterparts and Garfield surprising them with his fluency in Japanese.\", \"He, in fact, befriended an officer candidate of the Japanese Army who's also taking part in pilot training.\", '\"Officer Candidate Hideo Uchida.\" The officer candidate introduced himself in English when they first met.', '\"吳廣慶一級准尉。\" (Warrant Officer First Class Garfield Wu.) Garfield introduced himself as he bowed. \"請多多指教。\" (Pleased to meet you.)', '\"啊，你也會講日文啊?\" (Ah, you can speak Japanese too?) Uchida asked Garfield.', '\"是的。我曾經跟我家人搬回去臺灣住，所以我可以用日語、閩南語、客家語和中國的標準漢語溝通的。\" (Yes. My family and I once moved back to live in Taiwan for a while, so I can communicate in Japanese, Hokkien, Hakka and Mandarin Chinese as well.) Garfield replied.', '\"原來如此。\" (I see.) Uchida nodded understandingly.', \"Anyways, given that the 1970-1971 school year was Garfield's last prior to graduation, he had placed an order on the school yearbook, and when the yearbook finally arrived in June, he was among the students to get it early on.\", 'In the days that followed, Garfield gathered signatures accompanied by well-wishes from dozens of his friends and favourite teachers, plenty of which were written in Chinese while the vast majority were written in English.', 'Rahman, who together with Anita were among the first to write well-wishes and sign their names on his yearbook, later pointed out that Garfield has got his blank pages on the yearbook filled with signatures when he showed them his yearbook on the last day of school.', 'Only one friend left a bilingual signature and well-wish on his yearbook, and that friend was none other than Rebecca Lee, who wrote in both English and Chinese.', \"She was, in fact, one of the last of Garfield's friends to sign his yearbook and Garfield was lucky to run into her in the cafeteria on the last day of school.\", 'Speaking of Rebecca, Garfield find himself getting closer to her over the course of the first semester. He occasionally stayed with her in Design Tech. class after school as she worked on house design. They also worked together in building model houses for the class project in late January.', \"It was during this time that Garfield caught a glimpse of Rebecca's boyfriend when she brought him with her into the classroom, and he decided to focus more on finishing his model house to avoid feeling jealous.\", \"Sometime later, a few days before Valentine's Day, Garfield heard from rumours that Rebecca had broken up with her boyfriend, though he didn't think of it to be true until Rebecca told him and some friends about the fact during lunch period.\", 'By that point, it was the second semester and Garfield no longer shared a class with Rebecca, though he does see her from time to time and they will said hi to each other.', \"As a matter a fact, Garfield had invited Rebecca over to his 17th birthday party in June, though Rebecca later conferred with him and told him that she has to meet with a visiting relative that day and couldn't make it.\", 'Of course, Garfield was alright with the arrangement, especially since Rebecca still wished him a happy birthday and hoping that he enjoys his trip to Australia.', 'Anyways, during the course of his trip, first to Australia and then to Japan, when alone and seeing a beautiful scenery, Garfield had wished that Rebecca is with him to enjoy the trips, especially with the trip to Australia where he certainly be happy to introduce Rebecca to his aunts, uncles and cousins.', 'As he found himself developing feelings towards Rebecca, Garfield also thought that he should introduce her to Rahman, Anita and Jamie someday.', 'The more he thought about the idea, the more he liked it.', 'It was also during this time period that Garfield found himself in the spotlight again after he was instrumental in preventing an out-of-control, speeding streetcar from derailing this past early April.', 'It came after he returned home from Toronto following a conference, where he got off the CP Rail passenger train at Ottawa Union Station and got on the Route 4 streetcar heading for Carleton University and Billings Bridge.', 'The close-call came when the streetcar started to pick up on speed after making the turn from Bank Street onto Catherine Street, travelling along the Queensway and the Ottawa, Arnprior, Renfrew and Parry Sound Railway.', \"Then, the streetcar missed a couple of requested stops and when passengers begin to figure out something was amiss, they decided to check on the operator when he didn't respond to their yells that their stops has been missed.\", 'It was a lady passenger who discovered the operator slumped onto the dashboard, and she quickly turned and asked, \"Does anyone on board know how to operate a streetcar?\"', 'Everyone turned and looked at each other, where it was Garfield who stepped in.', '\"I\\'ve done my high school co-op at the OTC and part of it included some basics on how to operate a streetcar - in the car barns, of course.\" He quickly said. \"I may know a thing or two about applying the brakes. In the meantime, though, someone needs to provide first aid to the operator and fast.\"', \"At his remark, a handful of men on board moved to the front to pulled the driver off the seat so Garfield can take over. The task was more difficult considering the fact that they're on a moving streetcar that is accelerating.\", '\"You better be quick!\" The woman said. \"We\\'re fast-approaching Bronson Avenue!\"', \"Garfield nodded as he looked at the controls on the dashboard before seeing the fast-approaching red light ahead. They were maybe a couple blocks away from Bronson Avenue, but either way, time isn't on his side with the streetcar speeding up.\", 'As the passengers look over the unconscious driver, Garfield figured that he need to make some split decisions.', 'Pointing at some of the controls, he thought back to the time when he was shown how to apply the brakes on the streetcar.', 'With traffic on Catherine Street facing a red light and several cars are still running along Bronson Avenue, Garfield swiftly moved to ring the bell urgently with one hand while the second hand moved on the controls.', 'With Bronson Avenue one block away, Garfield quickly found the brakes and started to apply.', '\"Heads up!\" He exclaimed right before applying the brakes.', 'At his urgent application of the brakes, everyone on board lurched forward as the metal wheels coming to an abrupt stop screeches with the metal tracks.', 'At the intersection, several vehicles crossing the intersection came to an abrupt stop as the speeding OTC streetcar approaches the curved tracks turning left onto the southbound Bronson Avenue lanes.', 'The streetcar miraculously stayed on the tracks as it slowed down considerably before coming to a complete stop under the highway and railway bridge.', 'With the streetcar coming to a full stop, everyone on board sighed in relief as Garfield moved swiftly to pick up the phone.', '\"Operator, this is streetcar 417 right under the Queensway overpass on Bronson Avenue and we need to call 911 for the driver.\" He spoke urgently when the party on the other end answered.', 'Eventually, the paramedics arrived at the scene and took the unconscious operator to the hospital for observations.', 'And as things turned out, the passenger that provided first aid to the operator happened to be the air attaché posted at the Australian High Commission and the group captain commended Garfield for his bravery and maintaining calm during the situation.', \"The air attaché then recommended Garfield for a medal for bravery when he learned of Garfield's service with the Royal Canadian Air Cadets and made a note to inform the Australian high commissioner about the incident.\", \"And that's how a couple weeks after the close-call, Garfield received an invitation to Rideau Hall.\", 'Dressed in his cadet full service uniform and wearing the issued peaked cap, Garfield found himself in the company of a handful of other soldiers, where the Chief of the Defence Staff, RCAF Air Chief Marshal F. Sharp, personally award them with the medals for bravery.', \"It was one of Garfield's proudest days as he was congratulated by the witnesses present at the event, including the Governor General. A stern-looking army staff sergeant present at the event later told him in private after the ceremony that he should be proud of himself.\", \"That wasn't the only reward Garfield received with regards to his brave actions that day. Some weeks later, during one cadet training night, he received an invite from the visiting Chief of the Air Staff personally.\", 'In the invitation, Air Marshal Walter Connolly told Garfield that the Chairman of the Chief of Staffs Committee of the Australian military is going to visit Ottawa in the next few days and that he is going to award a medal of bravery to a certain cadet in recognition for his role in averting a serious streetcar accident in which a serving Royal Australian Air Force group captain was a passenger on board the out of control streetcar.', 'Needless to say, Garfield found himself with seven medal ribbons on his uniform, including one nominally awarded to Australian military personnel, by the time he was promoted to Warrant Officer First Class in late April, a promotion that came after St. Laurent reached his 19th birthday.', 'The promotion came with his appointment as the cadet squadron parade commander.', 'By the time of the annual passout parade in late May, he was made the cadet wing parade commander for all of 6th Wing.', 'Anyways, after returning from his exchange trip to Japan, Garfield relaxed and did plenty of biking on weekends while preparing himself for first year studies.', 'He took part in frosh week and made a few more friends with his group, and he thoroughly enjoyed the activities, which included dancing with the music and taking part in boat-building for a race on the Rideau Canal on the last day of Frosh Week.', 'The boat race is due to take place two days from today. Right now, Garfield is seated in his seat in a lecture hall for his afternoon calculus class.', 'As usual, Garfield seated on his own at the front, not that he minded - after all, it was a habit he began to develop after the lecture on the previous day.', 'The students chatted among themselves before the professor entered the lecture room and made his way to the front desk and blackboard.', 'It was 16:05 when the professor, with the ribbon microphone by his chin, started to speak.', '\"I\\'m assuming all of you are here for Calculus I for Engineers and Scientists.\" He spoke. \"If you\\'re not a scientist or engineer and are seated in this lecture hall, then either you\\'re in the wrong class, or you\\'re here in this class to raise some tough questions and give me a hard time.\"', 'There was a murmur of laughter from the students, and the professor smiled.', '\"Oh well.\" The professor continued after looking around the lecture hall and saw no one leaving the room. \"Since none of you are leaving, I\\'m assuming you\\'re all first year engineering or science students ready to take on calculus.\"', 'The professor then moved to the blackboard before continuing, \"Anyways, I believe an introduction is in order, though I should warn you that anyone who has read or is familiar with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\\'s series of biographies on the famous detective at the turn of the century London, Sherlock Holmes, will find my name to warrant your giving me a tough time throughout the semester.\"', 'Everyone in the lecture room arched their eyebrows, including Garfield, and there was some more murmuring from the students.', 'The professor then proceeded to write his name on the blackboard, and everyone leaned forward to take a good look at what he has written.', '\"Professor James Moriarty, Jr.\" The words read, and in an instant, you can hear a pin drop in the room.', '\"Yes.\" Professor Moriarty nodded. \"That\\'s my name, though I suppose most of you are aware of my grand uncle\\'s infamous reputation back in London.\"', '\"The Napoleon of Crime.\" One of the students at the back remarked.', '\"Exactly.\" Professor Moriarty said. \"Professor James Moriarty, Sr. is the infamous Napoleon of Crime who has been a thorn to Sherlock Holmes side in the course of his career, and James, Sr. happened to be my namesake.\"', 'One thing to note, folks, going forward: The Professor Moriarty in this particular story is the professor of Garfield\\'s calculus course (James \"Jim\" Moriarty, Jr.), not his infamous grand uncle, The Napoleon of Crime (James Moriarty, Sr., or the original Professor Moriarty).', \"Anyways, Happy New Year and stay tuned on what's to come.\", 'Dos minutos antes de la Medianoche.', 'La población entró en pánico cuando supo que anda suelto un asesino serial.

He wore a light brown jacket and just like his favorite tv show character, wore sunglasses all the time. He was a big cigar smoker and loved to down a glass of whiskey to finish off his shift.\", 'He walked into the living room. He surveyed the area, the television was tuned to a show about a reality family, and they were arguing. Silver picked up the remote that was on the couch and shut it off. Frank then looked at the couch, it was leather and had a pillow set at each end of it, and there was a blue blanket laying on the floor. He looked to where the officer was kneeling. On top of the coffee table was a bowl of what use to be freshly made popcorn. Once again it looked like the assailant was able to convince this woman into letting them into her apartment.', '\"Alright, where is it?\" Frank asked the officer who could hear the annoyance in his voice.', '\"Right here, sir.\" The officer replied as he pointed to the little piece of paper on the table.', '\"Did you look at it already?\" Frank asked.', '\"Yes sir, it\\'s the same message as the others.\"', '\"Stop calling me sir.

However under the circumstances Catherine had to do what she must. A promise was a promise after all.\", \"Catherine let out a sigh setting down her stitching. She glanced at the clock,closing time. Catherine blew to the side the light brown bangs that had swept into her face and stood brushing bits of fabric of her skirt. She put away the coat she was mending for Mr. Adams, a frequent customer who always seemed to rip his coat arms on the oddest objects, this time it had been a tree in the park. His wife always was most unsatisfied when she came to the shop requesting it be mended. Catherine always gave her a polite smile which she returned with a scornful look.

Catherine was fixed on buttoning her coat as walked in the thought what to serve for dinner that night that she didn\\'t realize where she was going and with a thump ran into something or rather someone. She blinked registering herself falling back from impact and a hand shooting out to catch her. Her pale blue eyes met the intent stare of sharp green ones. The person who had caught her was a man with burgundy hair that seemed as if it had never been combed, wearing a black tailcoat that hugged his slim figure, and wore an expression of intense thought. Catherine flinched as his grip tightened to keep her from falling. \"Do you recognize this substance?\" he inquired pulling out a handkerchief that was streaked with black similar to coal dust. He extended it out to her as he still held her from falling. Catherine blinked glancing at the substance about to say that it was coal but then seeing it glinted slightly she reached out and took the handkerchief sniffing it. \"Lubricating Grease, from the metal plant?\" She asked remember one of her friends husbands telling her of the grease that had been invented that worked more efficiently to lubricate the machinery at the metal plant downtown.', 'He stared at her a long moment and then his eyes widened.

I stepped back, determined not be in contact with either the patient or the metal trolley when the potentially life saving shock was delivered. The joules surged through the body on the table. \"Commence CPR.\" The doctor called as I began pumping the chest of the young woman again. None of us knew why the nameless woman was on the bed in the Resusitation Room. None of us like to think that far. We go through the potential causes, poison? trauma?, metabolic problem? illness? What can we fix? Can we save this person? Can we give their loved ones good news? Every time the staff of the Emergency Department battle to save someone we pray silently that this time. This time. This will be the day that we tell the husband, son, wife, daughter, mum or dad that the person they love will be ok.

There is no other job like it, and none that I would want but its exhausting.', '\"Ellie?\" I turn as my nickname catches my attention. Dean is starting to wonder if I\\'ve lost my marbles.

Innit?\"', '\"Yeah,\" The older man squeezes my shoulder. \"Be careful, her body and that trolley is forensic evidence.\" I glance at the trolley as doctors, anaesthetists and other nurses begin packing away. My chest aches at the sight of the young woman, dark hair matted with blood, skin like marble. I wonder if there is someone missing her. A boyfriend or girlfriend wondering why she hasn\\'t arrived home. Perhaps there are mates down the wine bar in town waiting for her, ringing her phone constantly. Maybe there\\'s a child wondering where Mummy is. That thought breaks me. I close my eyes, hoping that I\\'m wrong and some little child isn\\'t going to lose their mother.', '\"Ellie?\"', '\"What?\" I don\\'t mean to snap. \"Sorry.\"', '\"The police.\"', '\"Yeah, I know.

Jeff is one of the old school coppers. I like him. His height and general size may be intimidating to the local criminal population but to me its reassuring. He\\'s older than me, in his early fifties but his presence whenever we are dealing with the worst things people can do to each other is reassuring.', '\"It is. Any luck finding out next of kin?\"', '\"Checking to see if she\\'s been reported missing. Tracey thinks she arrested her a few weeks ago. Prostitution.\"', '\"Really?\" I look back at the corpse, now resting on the hospital trolley with clean sheets around her and the paraphernalia of resuscitation tidied away. I know Megan will want me to have her transferred to the mortuary as soon as possible but it doesn\\'t seem fair. She has no one. I can\\'t help but think that there isn\\'t a soul on the planet that deserves to die alone, that deserves not to be missed.', '\"Yeah. You know Tracey Parsons. She doesn\\'t forget a face. You alright chick?\"', '\"Fine. Can we just get on with this?\"', '\"You know the procedure Ellie. I stay until the Coroner orders otherwise. Or my Guv turns up.

He\\'s a cheeky one, always after a cuppa. Always saying how the nurses of old would look after the poor village policeman. Only, as I constantly remind him, it isn\\'t the land of Dixon of Dock Green and I am not an old fashioned nurse. \"If it is murder, what then?\"', '\"We investigate it. We find out who she is, who did it and send them to prison.\" Jeff frowned as I bite my lip. He turns away as his police radio begins to crackle. \"Yeah? I\\'m at the hospital now. Ok. Yeah.\" He pauses as it crackles again. I have no idea how he can make out a word of what is being said to him. I carry on with my paperwork, documenting everything that happened since the girl arrived in the hospital. Jeff turns back to me.', '\"Ok?\"', '\"Yeah. We have a name for her.

I turn back to see what\\'s going on and watch helplessly as the faceless person and my twin vanish into thin air. I kneel on the ground where they had been and find only a pile of leaves stained with blood.\"Jeff, where are you?\" I scream out in despair, grabbing my chest, unable to take in a full breath.I wake to the sound of my voice crying out for Jeff. Gasping for air, shaking, with tears streaming down my face, I sit upright and move to the edge of the bed, hyperventilating.Looking at the clock on my nightstand, I am reminded of what day it is. I am not looking forward to going to school.The second anniversary of Jeff\\'s disappearance has sparked an impromptu vigil at lunch, with some of his friends speaking about him, while the girls blubbered all over each other. It made me sick to watch them carry on.\"What a bunch of hypocrites,\" I mumble as I push my way through the crowd of kids all claiming to be sad.Steve, my brother\\'s best friend, grabs hold of my arm. \"Hey, what\\'s wrong with you? We\\'re just trying to remember Jeff. Why do you have to be such a jerk?\"\"What about me? Did you ever think about how this would affect me?\" I yank my arm out of his grip. \"You\\'re all a bunch of hypocrites! You stand around mourning Jeff, yet not once in two years have any of you asked me how I am! Not one of you!\"Steve balls up his fist, striking me in the jaw. \"This is not about you, Jackson! We as a student body lost Jeff too! He was our friend, and we have every right to remember him how we see fit. If you don\\'t like it, you can leave.\"I lunge at him, knocking him to the ground, punching him in the face. I stand up and point to my self with tears flowing down my face. \"He was my brother! I lost him! Not you! Me!\" It was my turn to be weak. My turn to mourn. To lash out about the injustice of it all.\"This is why no one cares about how you feel, Jackson!\" Steve shouts composing himself.The crowd parts and Heather, my best friend, rushes up. Tears smudge her makeup. Her bright blue eyes are full of sadness. She tried to be there for me for weeks after Jeff disappeared, but I wouldn\\'t let her. I wanted to be strong. I thought I had to be strong.\"Jackson, it\\'s ok. I\\'m right here.\"I almost collapse as she wraps her arms around my neck. Ignoring the gasps and stares of everyone around me, I cling to her with my face buried in her shoulder.\"I\\'m sorry,\" she cries in my ear. \"I had no idea you were in this much pain.\"I take a step back, wiping my face with my shirt. \"Well, it would seem you\\'re not alone. No one has bothered to ask me in all this time.\"\"I\\'m asking now. What can I do for you?\"\"Nothing, Heather. You have always been there for me, and I have done nothing to deserve it. Thank you for the shoulder to cry on, but I\\'ll be alright. I know Steve is waiting for you.\"\"Call me if you want to talk or even if you don\\'t. Don\\'t be a stranger anymore, Jackson.\"\"I don\\'t think Steve would appreciate it if we started talking again. It\\'s obvious he\\'s not my biggest fan.\"\"Leave Steve to me. He might be my boyfriend, but he doesn\\'t decide who my friends are. I want to be your friend again if you\\'ll let me.\"\"I\\'d like that,\" I respond hugging her.I get home to find my mom and dad sitting on the sofa talking.\"Want to tell us what happened at school today?\" My mom asks, sitting with her hand clasped in her lap. \"Steve\\'s mother called about a fight. Did you punch Steve in the face during a memorial for Jeff?\"I touch the bruise across my nose. \"Steve hit me too or does that not matter to you?\"\"Jackson, watch your tone. We only want to know what is going on with you. What are you so angry about?\"\"I\\'m angry because no one cares about me or how losing Jeff has affected my life! It\\'s all about them and their feelings. What about me and my feelings?\"Dad stands taking off his belt. \"Get on your knees, Jackson! I will not allow you to take out your frustrations on your classmates!\" He yells, pressing me to the floor.\"So I am getting a beating for being angry? Does that seem right to you, dad? Your only son is grieving, and instead of having compassion, you resort to whipping me?\"I kneel on the floor, shivering, knowing this is going to a doozy of a beating after that outburst, but it felt good to shout at him.\"How dare you speak to me that way!\"\"Gary, don\\'t. He\\'s right. Think about the message you\\'re sending.\"\"Helen, stay out of this. I don\\'t care if you\\'re grieving or not. You will show me the respect I deserve! Take off your shirt, Jackson.\"I look at my mom pleading with her to stop him, but she turns and walks out of the room, leaving me to my father and his temper. He pushes me to my hands, so my back is arched and proceeds to hit me with the leather strap until he is out of breath. Relenting, he lifts me by my arm.\"Go to bed, Jackson and think about how you want to continue.\"I retreat to my room too sore to do anything but flop on my stomach and sob. My parents don\\'t understand the anger I carry around inside me from that trip. Why was it Jeff and not me? How could something like this happen? I wanted answers, and I was more determined than ever to get them, no matter what.\\n', 'I find myself standing at the edge of a forest in a mountainous area. Tall pines surround me, and dry leaves crush under my bare feet. It\\'s cold, winter maybe. I wrap my arms around myself for warmth, but the wind fills the air with a bitter chill. A cabin sits in the distance. Smoke billows from the chimney, fading into the cold air.Jeff appears next to me drenched in sweat and covered in mud. I step in front of him. His eyes are dark. Bruises and blood cover his face.\"Jeff, what happened?\" I shout, shakily reaching out to grab his shoulders.My heart is pounding in my ears, and my knees are shaking at the sight of my twin. I have an opportunity to find out what happened if I can only get him to look at me. However, he doesn\\'t acknowledge me.\"Jeff, who\\'s after you? What\\'s happening?\"Footsteps crush leaves behind him causing him to gasp. He begins to run toward what looks like an old barn.I begin to charge after him, but everything is moving in slow motion. I am trying to scream for him to look out, but no sound comes from my throat. Trudging through the thick leaves and biting cold, I continue to cry for Jeff until my throat is raw.The unknown figure is getting closer. Jeff trips and his assailant closes the gap between them. Scrambling to his feet, the faceless attacker manages to grab him by the back of his shirt. He\\'s crying, screaming, flailing with all he has. I have frozen in my tracks just a few feet away, yet it feels like miles. I turn away not wanting to feel the pain of what my brother is experiencing.The air stills around me and goosebumps form on my skin. Something is not right.

Relenting, he lifts me by my arm.\"Go to bed, Jackson and think about how you want to continue.\"I retreat to my room too sore to do anything but flop on my stomach and sob. My parents don\\'t understand the anger I carry around inside me from that trip. Why was it Jeff and not me? How could something like this happen? I wanted answers, and I was more determined than ever to get them, no matter what.\\n', '\"Jeff, who\\'s after you? What\\'s happening?\"Footsteps crush leaves behind him causing him to gasp. He begins to run toward what looks like an old barn.I begin to charge after him, but everything is moving in slow motion. I am trying to scream for him to look out, but no sound comes from my throat. Trudging through the thick leaves and biting cold, I continue to cry for Jeff until my throat is raw.The unknown figure is getting closer. Jeff trips and his assailant closes the gap between them. Scrambling to his feet, the faceless attacker manages to grab him by the back of his shirt. He\\'s crying, screaming, flailing with all he has. I have frozen in my tracks just a few feet away, yet it feels like miles. I turn away not wanting to feel the pain of what my brother is experiencing.The air stills around me and goosebumps form on my skin. Something is not right. I turn back to see what\\'s going on and watch helplessly as the faceless person and my twin vanish into thin air. I kneel on the ground where they had been and find only a pile of leaves stained with blood.\"Jeff, where are you?\" I scream out in despair, grabbing my chest, unable to take in a full breath.I wake to the sound of my voice crying out for Jeff. Gasping for air, shaking, with tears streaming down my face, I sit upright and move to the edge of the bed, hyperventilating.Looking at the clock on my nightstand, I am reminded of what day it is. I am not looking forward to going to school.The second anniversary of Jeff\\'s disappearance has sparked an impromptu vigil at lunch, with some of his friends speaking about him, while the girls blubbered all over each other. It made me sick to watch them carry on.\"What a bunch of hypocrites,\" I mumble as I push my way through the crowd of kids all claiming to be sad.Steve, my brother\\'s best friend, grabs hold of my arm. \"Hey, what\\'s wrong with you? We\\'re just trying to remember Jeff. Why do you have to be such a jerk?\"\"What about me? Did you ever think about how this would affect me?\" I yank my arm out of his grip. \"You\\'re all a bunch of hypocrites! You stand around mourning Jeff, yet not once in two years have any of you asked me how I am! Not one of you!\"Steve balls up his fist, striking me in the jaw. \"This is not about you, Jackson! We as a student body lost Jeff too! He was our friend, and we have every right to remember him how we see fit. If you don\\'t like it, you can leave.\"I lunge at him, knocking him to the ground, punching him in the face. I stand up and point to my self with tears flowing down my face. \"He was my brother! I lost him! Not you! Me!\" It was my turn to be weak. My turn to mourn. To lash out about the injustice of it all.\"This is why no one cares about how you feel, Jackson!\" Steve shouts composing himself.The crowd parts and Heather, my best friend, rushes up. Tears smudge her makeup. Her bright blue eyes are full of sadness. She tried to be there for me for weeks after Jeff disappeared, but I wouldn\\'t let her. I wanted to be strong. I thought I had to be strong.\"Jackson, it\\'s ok. I\\'m right here.\"I almost collapse as she wraps her arms around my neck. Ignoring the gasps and stares of everyone around me, I cling to her with my face buried in her shoulder.\"I\\'m sorry,\" she cries in my ear. \"I had no idea you were in this much pain.\"I take a step back, wiping my face with my shirt. \"Well, it would seem you\\'re not alone. No one has bothered to ask me in all this time.\"\"I\\'m asking now. What can I do for you?\"\"Nothing, Heather. You have always been there for me, and I have done nothing to deserve it. Thank you for the shoulder to cry on, but I\\'ll be alright. I know Steve is waiting for you.\"\"Call me if you want to talk or even if you don\\'t. Don\\'t be a stranger anymore, Jackson.\"\"I don\\'t think Steve would appreciate it if we started talking again. It\\'s obvious he\\'s not my biggest fan.\"\"Leave Steve to me. He might be my boyfriend, but he doesn\\'t decide who my friends are. I want to be your friend again if you\\'ll let me.\"\"I\\'d like that,\" I respond hugging her.I get home to find my mom and dad sitting on the sofa talking.\"Want to tell us what happened at school today?\" My mom asks, sitting with her hand clasped in her lap. \"Steve\\'s mother called about a fight. Did you punch Steve in the face during a memorial for Jeff?\"I touch the bruise across my nose. \"Steve hit me too or does that not matter to you?\"\"Jackson, watch your tone. We only want to know what is going on with you. What are you so angry about?\"\"I\\'m angry because no one cares about me or how losing Jeff has affected my life! It\\'s all about them and their feelings. What about me and my feelings?\"Dad stands taking off his belt. \"Get on your knees, Jackson! I will not allow you to take out your frustrations on your classmates!\" He yells, pressing me to the floor.\"So I am getting a beating for being angry? Does that seem right to you, dad? Your only son is grieving, and instead of having compassion, you resort to whipping me?\"I kneel on the floor, shivering, knowing this is going to a doozy of a beating after that outburst, but it felt good to shout at him.\"How dare you speak to me that way!\"\"Gary, don\\'t. He\\'s right. Think about the message you\\'re sending.\"\"Helen, stay out of this. I don\\'t care if you\\'re grieving or not. You will show me the respect I deserve!

If you don\\'t like it, you can leave.\"I lunge at him, knocking him to the ground, punching him in the face. I stand up and point to my self with tears flowing down my face. \"He was my brother! I lost him! Not you! Me!\" It was my turn to be weak. My turn to mourn. To lash out about the injustice of it all.\"This is why no one cares about how you feel, Jackson!\" Steve shouts composing himself.The crowd parts and Heather, my best friend, rushes up. Tears smudge her makeup. Her bright blue eyes are full of sadness. She tried to be there for me for weeks after Jeff disappeared, but I wouldn\\'t let her. I wanted to be strong. I thought I had to be strong.\"Jackson, it\\'s ok. I\\'m right here.\"I almost collapse as she wraps her arms around my neck. Ignoring the gasps and stares of everyone around me, I cling to her with my face buried in her shoulder.\"I\\'m sorry,\" she cries in my ear. \"I had no idea you were in this much pain.\"I take a step back, wiping my face with my shirt. \"Well, it would seem you\\'re not alone. No one has bothered to ask me in all this time.\"\"I\\'m asking now. What can I do for you?\"\"Nothing, Heather. You have always been there for me, and I have done nothing to deserve it. Thank you for the shoulder to cry on, but I\\'ll be alright. I know Steve is waiting for you.\"\"Call me if you want to talk or even if you don\\'t. Don\\'t be a stranger anymore, Jackson.\"\"I don\\'t think Steve would appreciate it if we started talking again. It\\'s obvious he\\'s not my biggest fan.\"\"Leave Steve to me. He might be my boyfriend, but he doesn\\'t decide who my friends are. I want to be your friend again if you\\'ll let me.\"\"I\\'d like that,\" I respond hugging her.I get home to find my mom and dad sitting on the sofa talking.\"Want to tell us what happened at school today?\" My mom asks, sitting with her hand clasped in her lap. \"Steve\\'s mother called about a fight. Did you punch Steve in the face during a memorial for Jeff?\"I touch the bruise across my nose. \"Steve hit me too or does that not matter to you?\"\"Jackson, watch your tone. We only want to know what is going on with you. What are you so angry about?\"\"I\\'m angry because no one cares about me or how losing Jeff has affected my life! It\\'s all about them and their feelings. What about me and my feelings?\"Dad stands taking off his belt. \"Get on your knees, Jackson! I will not allow you to take out your frustrations on your classmates!\" He yells, pressing me to the floor.\"So I am getting a beating for being angry? Does that seem right to you, dad? Your only son is grieving, and instead of having compassion, you resort to whipping me?\"I kneel on the floor, shivering, knowing this is going to a doozy of a beating after that outburst, but it felt good to shout at him.\"How dare you speak to me that way!\"\"Gary, don\\'t. He\\'s right. Think about the message you\\'re sending.\"\"Helen, stay out of this. I don\\'t care if you\\'re grieving or not. You will show me the respect I deserve! Take off your shirt, Jackson.\"I look at my mom pleading with her to stop him, but she turns and walks out of the room, leaving me to my father and his temper. He pushes me to my hands, so my back is arched and proceeds to hit me with the leather strap until he is out of breath. Relenting, he lifts me by my arm.\"Go to bed, Jackson and think about how you want to continue.\"I retreat to my room too sore to do anything but flop on my stomach and sob. My parents don\\'t understand the anger I carry around inside me from that trip. Why was it Jeff and not me? How could something like this happen? I wanted answers, and I was more determined than ever to get them, no matter what.\\n', 'I wake to the sound of my voice crying out for Jeff. Gasping for air, shaking, with tears streaming down my face, I sit upright and move to the edge of the bed, hyperventilating.Looking at the clock on my nightstand, I am reminded of what day it is. I am not looking forward to going to school.The second anniversary of Jeff\\'s disappearance has sparked an impromptu vigil at lunch, with some of his friends speaking about him, while the girls blubbered all over each other. It made me sick to watch them carry on.\"What a bunch of hypocrites,\" I mumble as I push my way through the crowd of kids all claiming to be sad.Steve, my brother\\'s best friend, grabs hold of my arm. \"Hey, what\\'s wrong with you? We\\'re just trying to remember Jeff. Why do you have to be such a jerk?\"\"What about me?

We as a student body lost Jeff too! He was our friend, and we have every right to remember him how we see fit.

I lost him! Not you! Me!\" It was my turn to be weak. My turn to mourn. To lash out about the injustice of it all.\"This is why no one cares about how you feel, Jackson!\" Steve shouts composing himself.The crowd parts and Heather, my best friend, rushes up. Tears smudge her makeup. Her bright blue eyes are full of sadness. She tried to be there for me for weeks after Jeff disappeared, but I wouldn\\'t let her. I wanted to be strong. I thought I had to be strong.\"Jackson, it\\'s ok. I\\'m right here.\"I almost collapse as she wraps her arms around my neck.

Your only son is grieving, and instead of having compassion, you resort to whipping me?\"I kneel on the floor, shivering, knowing this is going to a doozy of a beating after that outburst, but it felt good to shout at him.\"How dare you speak to me that way!\"\"Gary, don\\'t.

Relenting, he lifts me by my arm.\"Go to bed, Jackson and think about how you want to continue.\"I retreat to my room too sore to do anything but flop on my stomach and sob.

The hunting season had already started; the time when many wild animals were killed only for sport and protection. It was not strange for the villagers to fear such animals. Not only were they carnivores, but they carried many different diseases that could not be allowed to spread through the thin forest. In that regard, perhaps the humans were simply doing the right thing.', 'Women were left behind inside their homes, protecting the young and old. Men, instead, left carrying heavy rifles and camouflage clothing. Out, in the streets, enormous dogs were walking around, as if they owned the place.', \"Matt was relatively young, but he was mature enough to understand this strange ritual. He looked out the window, and he could see his father; a muscular and hairy man in his late fifties, clearly experienced, but stern. His piercing glare was often terrifying, and Matt had to live with the fear that his father might, someday, snap and attack him. But despite that fear, he couldn't help but admire the old guy as he stood outside their home, gun raised, keeping a close watch and making sure no wild animal would even dare approach.\", 'One unlucky gray dog decided to investigate. Matt looked at it closely; it was huge, bigger than any dog he had seen in the village. Its fur was messy and dirty, and it had a hungry look in its face, that much he could understand.', \"His father didn't hesitate. He shot the creature right between the eyes, blood staining its entire head and a bit of the ground. The dog collapsed, unmoving, its eyes wide open. It would be forever unable to understand how human technology worked, and how efficient and dangerous guns were for their kind.\", '\"Matthew, come back here!\"', \"He could hear his mother approaching him from behind, and blocking his eyes with both hands. After all, she couldn't allow him to witness such cruelty, even if it was for the good of their village.\", '\"But I want to see dad hunting those dogs!\" Matt complained, resisting in his mother\\'s grip. Since she wasn\\'t grabbing him with much force, it was easy for him to escape, but he was grabbed by the arm before he could move a step.', '\"No,\" she commanded sternly. \"It\\'s past your bedtime. Let\\'s go.\"', \"Matt obediently followed. He took a quick glance behind; the sound of thunder made him jump. No, that wasn't thunder—it was a gunshot. Did his dad just kill another dog? He couldn't see, and before long he was out of the room, dragged by his mother.\", '\"Why are they doing this?\" the boy asked in pure innocence. The mother decided not to reply to his question.', '\"Go to sleep, you have to wake up early tomorrow. And no more questions,\" she added before the boy could interrupt. \"It will be a long day.\"', 'Even though the little boy was unable to understand this, his father was certainly aware of what was happening. Whenever he raised his gun, he repeated to himself that this was for the well-being of his family and friends. These dogs could not be allowed to live.', '\"Dogs,\" he snorted. Yes, of course they weren\\'t dogs. Which kind of dog would leave isolated, so far away from the humans that gave them food and protection?', 'These creatures were wolves.', '\"Everything good?\" He barely noticed the old man approaching behind him. He almost pointed at him instinctively, but the sound of his voice prevented that from happening.', '\"Excellent, Wyatt,\" he said clearly satisfied. \"Very few approached this house; probably they already know what awaits them.\"', '\"Jacob, please don\\'t get too excited,\" the older man warned. \"We don\\'t want to bring their species to extinction.\" His tone of voice was irritating; Jacob already knew this. But these animals had to be killed, and he shouldn\\'t be feeling guilty about enjoying this hunt.', '\"Yeah, yeah,\" Jacob replied. But it sounded like he didn\\'t even care. \"Regardless, I don\\'t want that disgusting disease anywhere near me. If they could just stay in their forest, they wouldn\\'t have to go through this.\" He chuckled, his mouth twisted in a strange smile. \"It is their fault for messing with us.\"', '\"They have no choice,\" Wyatt reasoned. \"They are animals. They don\\'t have our ability to reason, and they seem desperate as well.\"', 'Jacob spun around when he heard a twig cracking. He raised his gun, noticing a wolf jumping right at him, paws outstretched, jaw wide open showing large yellow fangs. He pulled the trigger, aiming for its heart. The wolf fell down at his feet, convulsing uncontrollably, before it fell still.', 'As Jacob rejoiced, proud of his kill, Wyatt simply shook his head.', '\"I\\'ll never get used to this.\"', '\"Hey, if you want to save wolves so bad, why not keep one as a pet?\" Jacob laughed mockingly, kicking the corpse of the wolf.', \"Its expression was terrifying. Wyatt could almost feel like its blood-red eyes were staring at him, blaming him for not stopping the other man. The jaws were still open, as if they were eager to consume him. And, he was probably imagining things, but he felt like the wolf did not attack out of self-defense, nor because it was hungry. It attacked to kill, to get revenge on its fallen comrades. But he knew that was ridiculous; wolves did not have human's ability to reason.\", 'But, if they had… what would it say?', '\"Don\\'t look so gloomy.\" A harsh pat on the shoulder forced him out of his trance. Jacob was already out of bullets, but it seemed like the village was quieter now. \"Next time I will get you a pet.\"', \"Wyatt replied with a smile, almost hidden beneath his white beard. He knew Jacob meant that in a mean-spirited way, but he wasn't impolite enough to reply with the same venom. If only he would listen more to his advice and, at least, consider it.\", '\"Better go back home,\" Wyatt advised. \"Your wife will be missing you, won\\'t she?\"', '\"Probably,\" Jacob replied uninterested and seemingly disappointed as well. The killing was over after all, and for him that meant the fun was over as well. It was scary, how eager this man was about murdering animals.', \"Jacob started walking, rifle on his shoulder, with Wyatt following closely behind. He wasn't carrying any weapons; he did have his own to hunt, but he realized they wouldn't be needed.\", '\"Why do you say that? We would get rid of these mutts faster.\"', '\"I know,\" the old guy nodded. \"But this time they were fewer than usual, and it seems more people managed to get rifles this year.\" Wyatt sighed, defeated. \"And… my eyesight is starting to fail me. I wouldn\\'t be able to shot anything in this condition.\"', '\"Huh. And here I was thinking it was because you had become softer these days. Ever since your cat died, you\\'ve become a lazy pile of bones.\"', \"Sometimes, Wyatt wished Jacob didn't have such a sharp tongue. They weren't that far apart in terms of age, and it wouldn't be much longer before Jacob would start becoming weaker due to his age. Not to mention he wasn't exactly having a healthy lifestyle either.\", '\"Death will come to you soon.\"', '\"I think it\\'s coming to you sooner. You\\'re much older than me, Wyatt.\" Jacob laughed loudly, but Wyatt just stopped and stared at him, as if he had seen a ghost.', '\"I didn\\'t say anything.\"', \"He felt a shiver down his spine. That voice; it was deep, icy and emotionless. It certainly didn't belong to him. And it had come from behind him.\", 'Wyatt slowly turned around…', 'But there was nothing there.', 'Jacob had turned around as well, but he gave out an exasperated sigh when he was unable to see anything either.', '\"Stop freaking out so much.

But something told him he had to run.', 'But despite that, a loose root made him lose his footing, falling face-first into the floor.', 'His entire body hurt.

It was a demon; a creature from another world, which had come only to attack him and take him to Hell.

As a result when on set, under the hot lights, and in front of the hastily run-up back-drops well, anything could happen.\", '\"So, we start again, eh?\" Gautermann, Heinrich to his friends—but they were all still over in Germany,—surveyed the field of his operations with a dismal scowl. \"OK, we go—Marnie—Lights?\"', '\"Yeah, boss,—Hot!\"', '\"James, you good for Sound?\"', '\"—no, the other way, Bernie, up to the thirty mark; yeah, that\\'s right.

The actors merely changed hot Klieg lights for the burning Sun; the tight restraints and stuffy atmosphere of the enclosed stage for the hot dusty desert; with all its sand, loose rocks, and other dangers. Then there was the interminable waiting around while the production crew got everything settled to their individual satisfaction. The electric lights, supplied by generator, when it worked, were enhanced by large silvered metal reflectors, hand-held by workers behind the camera or off-screen by a few yards—but still near enough to blind the actors with the reflected light. No, filming on location was never a bed of roses; even when everything went smoothly.', '\"Ach, the Sun shines so!\" Gautermann realising the obvious on the first morning of location work, wiping his brow with a green bandana. \"So, we start, no?

And he had spotted a rattlesnake in the instant it broke cover from a clump of thick dry grass and started to make its way towards his star's foot.\", \"Stephanie raced across, grabbed Kelly's arm, and dragged her yards away from the danger zone. Meanwhile the crew came forward to eyeball the snake lying twisted on the dusty ground, completely dead, having been cut in two by Gautermann's bullets.\", '\"All is well.

Then Gautermann began speaking in German.', '—O—', '\"Third, is it?\"', '\"Yep.\"', 'Kelly, sitting beside Stephanie on a large warm boulder off to one side of the jumble of equipment that went to making up a location shoot, pursed her lips thoughtfully.', '\"First take, those cars on that dam\\' country lane.

Come on, Gautermann\\'s turnin\\' a lovely shade o\\'lavender, again, awaiting our presence.\"', '—O—', 'With the European situation being what it was, politically speaking, a large number of foreign movie related personnel had come over to the States looking for fresh fields and pastures new, of whom Heinrich Gautermann was a prime example. Stephanie and Kelly were momentarily at a standstill, while the crew set-up a new position for the coming scene, allowing them time to gossip together—always a good hobby and excellent method of passing time while on location.', '\"What kind\\'a movies\\' he make back in the Fatherland, then?\" Kelly always being up for the inside grift.', '\"Mystical, strange, intellectual.\" Stephanie shook her head glumly. \"Saw one six months ago—ful\\'la montages ya can\\'t make head nor tail of.

As on every movie of this kind, though, there was a wrangler in charge of the said beasts—for what that was worth.\", '\"Just as well we don\\'t need a herd o\\'cattle fer this story.\" Stephanie acknowledging the good point of the whole sorry affair.', '\"Yeah, these dam\\' hosses are enough trouble by themselves.\" Kelly scratching her head as both women stood to one side of the location set watching the back-up actors handling their steeds. \"I know Sam Fuller, there; but the other two, they don\\'t look like they know how t\\'ride.\"', 'Her words were even then proven to be accurate as all three horses, complete with powerless riders, decided to quit for the day and made a concentrated rush for the main camera unit, plus Producer and Director.', '\"Verrückte Pferde.

The term black as night never being so appropriate as when out in the desert with only the stars as illumination. There were a few electric lights on tall stands, powered by petrol-driven generators which, while obviously necessary, made a damn lot of noise. It also meant the Lighting Department came into its own, above and beyond all other Departments, for the time being. Covering scenes at night was usually a much slower activity than doing the same in broad daylight. And, of course, the local wildlife came to the fore, attracted by the bright light—this consisting of everything from coyotes wailing in the middle-distance to moths and large biting flies whirling all round and getting in the way of the actors as they worked in front of the rolling cameras.', '\"Und so fangen wir in der Nacht an.

Then came the stunt scene.', 'The thing about stuntmen, because they were generally male, was their well-known propensity to be three reefs to the wind at any particular moment—that is, they were all quite generally visualised as being barking mad; something that tended to show in their actions on set.', '\"Nein, nein, Mr Hamilton; I do not want you to roll the car three times and end up on the roof in the dust; this is not a James Cagney movie.

Just hit the tree. I am a simple man, and nothing more will make me supremely happy, OK?\"', 'Having to capture the dramatic moment on film, in this modern-day portion of the movie, the camera and its crew had to be positioned fairly close to the dusty track that passed for a road. The Director, too, crouched by the side of the camera as was also usual, to appreciate the best view of the whole scene; and so—', '\"Ready? I say,—Ready? Jesus, will someone shout to that fool? Ready, go? Go? Gott, er kann mich nicht hören. Ah, he is moving finally, at last—\"', '\"Heinrich, you never told me to roll, y\\'know.\"', '\"What? You are not rolling? Jeesus, stop the car. Stop! Stop! Someone stop that madman. Stop! Gott, was macht er?\"', \"Hamilton, feeling vibrant full of himself and energetic to a degree, had decided to ad-lib—not so easy when driving a two-ton car. Instead of the conservative, almost boring one might say, head-on slow bump into a tree, he had decided that what this movie badly needed to ginger it up was a full-on car mash-up—and wasn't he just the expert who could provide such to order? So the raving fool did—\", \"Before Gautermann's unbelieving eyes Hamilton twisted his saloon's steering-wheel violently—so much so, in fact, the relatively high centre of gravity rolled the car over as by a giant invisible hand.

Ah, ja, Scene Forty-seven D—this scene I feel I can do something spectacular with. You are both in the scene together, nein? And you, Miss Garroch, are wholly opposed to Miss Humber, nein? You hate each other—\"', '\"Our characters\\' do, at least. If that\\'s what you mean, Heinrich?\" Stephanie angling for sense in this conversation.', '\"Ja, ja, your characters\\', of course, what else?\" Gautermann shook his head indifferently. \"For real it is perfectly clear to one and all you two are, how is it said in American?, wahre liebhaber, nein?\"', '\"If ya say so, Heinrich.\" Stephanie not altogether clear as to his meaning, but nervous he was coming too near the truth for public consumption.', '\"Ach, it is nothing—in Deutschland we take this with a pinch of salt, and think nothing of it; it is merely Nature.\" Gautermann here showing an open-mindedness neither woman had previously noted in his make-up. \"So, in this scene I want you both to give your all, you understand?\"', '\"You want us to go for it, Heinrich?\" Kelly frowning, but almost seeing what was wanted.', '\"Go for it? Ja, that will be perfect—go for it, for all you are worth, both of you. Do not hold back—in Deutschland our actresses do not hold back—that is why, of all the world, they are of course the bes—er, that is, we shall start the scene in a short moment, if you will both take your places, ja?\"', 'Everyone moved to their either official or chosen places in the echoing shed that formed the big Stage.', '\"So, silence on the stage, everyone.\"', '\"Quiet!\"', '\"Frank, why do you have to yell so loud? Ich habe ohrenschmerzen. OK, this is to be a great scene; you will all revere it when it is over. So, we begin—Lights?\"', '\"Is that Klieg ever gon\\'na be fixed, Terry? No? Huh. Oh,—Hot, Heinrich!\"', '\"Ich bin so froh. Sound?\"', '\"Speed!\"', '\"What?\"', '\"Speed, Heinrich. I\\'m ready, it\\'s Speed!\"', '\"Gott, fast unnatürlich! Camera?\"', '\"Rollin\\' sweet an\\' true, baby—I mean Heinrich, sir!\"', '\"Gott, was für ein Mob! Now remember, ladies—go for everything you have; break the scenery if you wish—but give it all. Action!\"', 'And they did, and it was perfect on the first take.', '\"Oh, ich bin der glücklichste Regisseur in Amerika!\"', '—O—', 'The day after filming finished Stephanie and Kelly sat on the sofa in the living-room of their shared condo in Hollywood, going over the previous few weeks work.', '\"That guy Gautermann\\'s a great Director.\" Kelly giving credit where she felt it due.', '\"Yeah, ran a tight smooth ship; hardly any problems or hiccups at all.\" Stephanie no less sweeping in her praise. \"And he brought the show in under budget and seven days early in the schedule.\"', '\"And got some great shots; some of those location scenes he captured are real doozies, dear.\"', '\"Yeah, and that quarrel scene between us, that was some of the best acting you\\'ve ever done, lady.\"', 'Kelly grinned at her amour, happy to be so praised.', '\"Not that you weren\\'t right up there alongside me, baby. Couldn\\'t have done it without you, that\\'s all.\"', '\"That\\'s very nice of you.\" Stephanie scrunched up a little closer to her loved partner. \"So much so, in fact, I feel it needs something in the way of a little present, y\\'know.\"', '\"Oh, yeah?\" Kelly wholly aware of what was in her lover\\'s mind, and loving it. \"What might that turn out t\\'be, then?

Aagh!\"', 'The End', '—O—', \"The next 'Redoubtable Studios' story will be along shortly.\", '—OOO—', 'Soft pitters of rain bounced off the windows. The skies were a deep gray as storm clouds drifted along. The rain was light, no thunder or lightening yet. The somber building of the funeral home was lit with warm lamps to fight against the dimness outside. Two different families and a collection of friends populated inside. The Collins family was large, with many cousins, aunts, and uncles. Emma and Jonathan Collins are currently standing beside a photograph of one of their two children. They stand there, trying to keep their eyes from continuing to stray to the beaming photo as they converse and thank those who came. The Evans family is smaller with a grandmother, uncle and two cousins speaking with one another. James Evans had excused himself a few minutes ago, leaving his remaining daughter to speak with the guests.', \"Jasper Collins is standing off to the side with his boyfriend. The young man hadn't stopped crying the whole ceremony. He leaned against Spande's taller frame as the tears flowed unendingly. Vanemy is next to them sitting down with her baby sister in her lap. Despite having two of her close friend's funerals today, her parents had still stuck little Verity with her. So she sat with Raven and Keily trying as they tried to get the fussy toddler to stop crying. A few rows ahead of the three girls Oliver could be found sitting alone with his eyes permanently glued to his hands, which were scrunched up in his lap. With his girlfriend with Vanemy, he wished Toma were there to sit with him. However, Toma had skipped out on the funeral. No one knew where he was, nor would he answer their calls. Valerian could be found walking up to his girlfriend as the guests speaking to her walked away. His hand found Lily's shoulder, but he remained distant.\", \"And finally, Bryson could be found looking down at the partially open casket with sad eyes. The boy looked down at the girl in the casket, her eyes closed with makeup newly applied to hide the truth on her face. Bryson had to admit, they'd done a good job covering the bruises up. Still, even if she looked as beautiful as the day he'd first met her, she was still gone. Those bouncing brown curls of her seemingly dull and lifeless now that she was dead. She had always loved her hair, how it was so long and curly and how it just seemed to move along with her and shine. Bryson made himself peel his eyes away from Brooklyn as he felt his eyes brim with tears. He turned and stepped away, spotting Kirron not too far away. He could tell right away that his best friend was having an internal struggle of his own.\", '\"Kirron\" he approached the white-haired male, \"you don\\'t look so well.\"', '\"My stomach hurts.\" He stated flatly. \"Did you...say goodbye yet?\"', 'Bryson nodded, \"I saw her. Have you?\"', '\"I don\\'t think I want to.\" He sighed.', '\"You really should Kirron. The last time you saw her was in a morgue, don\\'t have that be the last image you have of her.\" Kirron exhaled deeply from his nose and moved to the other casket with Bryson at his side. The girl inside looked peaceful. Her sandy blonde locks fell in soft waves against the white plush of the casket. Her makeup was done much like Brooklyn\\'s, which slightly bothered Kirron. Oddly enough he had rather of seen whatever cuts or bruises that were on her face. As odd as that may have sounded, Emily had never liked makeup and he had always thought she looked best without it. Bryson put his hand on Kirron\\'s shoulder as the male brushed at his wet eyes. Kirron reached inside of the jacket of his suit, pulling the rose from his pocket. It was a plain, red rose with a small white note attacked. It was Kirron\\'s own goodbye to his girlfriend as he delicately laid it down. Bryson patted his friends back as the headed back towards the others. They could hear the second set of cries as Keily took Verity as Vanemy doubled over crying. And if you were to pass by the door you could almost hear Raven\\'s muffled yelling as she left Toma yet another message, her voice teetering on the edge of crying.', 'Two days later when the girls were buried it rained as well. Kirron stayed longer, black umbra laying against his shoulder as he stared at the gravestones. Bryson hung back a bit waiting for him. He didn\\'t act like it, but Kirron knew he was struggling on his own over the girl\\'s deaths. \"I miss you, Emily.\" He said quietly as his eyes drifted around the assortments of flowers surrounding the grave. He bent down to pick up a small unfamiliar pot. He found no name or indication of who had sent it. It was just a single white orchid sitting there. He found an identical one on Brooklyn\\'s grave as well. Kirron dropped the flower back down and turned to rush to Bryson\\'s side so that they could head back with the others. Everyone was going to get together at his place one more time.', '\"Are you okay?\" Kirron asked.', 'Bryson didn\\'t have an umbrella, so he ducked under Kirrons. \"No\" he admitted. \"Are you?\"', '\"Not in the slightest,\" Kirron spoke as they headed for their cars.', \"Hours later as darkness overtook the sky and the rain slowed to a light drizzle and everyone was home and asleep another person dropped by the girl's graves. Dressed in all black with no one around to see them as the stood there for a long minute. The only identifiable thing about them being the small glow of a lit cigarette held lax in their hand as the dropped a large bustle of yellow daisies between the girl's graves. They left after a long drag of the cigarette, disappearing as if no one had been there at all.\", \"Well, here's the short start to my newest short story. Next chapter we'll be getting into more details over what happened to the girls, as well as the start of the real mystery beginning. until then, hope you enjoyed.\", 'Sólo vengo a dejar esto por aquí y me retiraré lentamente...', 'De antemano, gracias por leer :D', 'Miguel era un niño de siete años muy feliz. Era hijo único y vivía con sus padres, quienes eran pintores, en una casa modesta al norte del pequeño pueblo. Fue en una tarde que su vida cambió. El niño se encontraba jugando en el patio de su casa, cuando vio a la niña de cabello rubio que había en frente de él. El vestido que traía era completamente blanco y estaba descalza, pero eso no fue lo que más le llamó la atención; si no esa bonita y cálida sonrisa. Después de algunos segundos, se acercó lo suficiente a la extraña para poder hablarle. Estando mucho más cerca se dio cuenta de que ella poseía unos ojos verdes muy parecidos a los suyos.', '―Hola ―saludó Miguel. ―Nunca te había visto por aquí.', 'Ella no le respondió. Simplemente se quedó allí, sin borrar esa sonrisa de sus labios. Miguel hizo una pequeña mueca. ¿Será que ella no quería hablarle? pero si ese fuese el caso, ¿por qué entró en su casa? Aquel pensamiento lo hizo abrir los ojos mostrando claros signos de sorpresa, mientras la niña ladeó la cabeza confundida.', '―¿Por qué estás en mi casa? ―preguntó. Más nuevamente, no obtuvo ninguna respuesta. ―¿Qué acaso no hablas?', 'Lo cierto fue que Miguel nunca obtuvo una respuesta. Aun así, eso no fue impedimento para que él jugara con ella. Después de todo, era el primero niño más o menos de su edad que veía en su vecindario por lo que estaba muy emocionado. En la noche, mientras cenaba con sus padres, les contó acerca de la niña que había conocido y con quien había jugado.', '―Me parece muy lindo de tu parte que hayas invitado a esa pequeña a jugar contigo aquí en la casa ―dijo la madre del niño.', '―No, no ―Miguel ladeó la cabeza de una lado a otro. ―Yo no la invité. Ella apareció en el patio de un momento a otro.', 'La pareja se miró extrañada. ¿Cómo era eso posible? su hijo estaba siendo constantemente vigilado por María, la niñera, así que ella no pudo haber pasado por alto el hecho de decirles que una extraña había entrado en su casa y había jugado con Miguel.', 'A la mañana siguiente, el matrimonio habló con la niñera. María les dijo que en ningún momento habían entrado una niña a la casa. El pequeño Miguel había estado jugando todo el tiempo solo. Por esa razón ella no había comunicado ninguna novedad a sus jefes.', 'Otra cosa, que sin duda los alarmó un poco, fue el hecho de enterarse que al vecindario no se había mudado nadie nuevo. A raíz de eso, la madre de Miguel decidió quedarse ese día en casa. Esto con el fin de vigilar un poco más a su pequeño.', 'Fue un poco más allá de las tres de la tarde, cuando la madre de Miguel tuvo que ir a atender una llamada, que la misteriosa niña volvió a aparecer. Seguía sonriendo, aún vestida de blanco y con los pies descalzos. Esta vez Miguel no le dio mucha importancia a su aparición de la nada. Simplemente sonrió y la invitó a jugar canicas con él. Y así fue como lo encontró su madre. Riéndose a carcajadas, jugando canicas y hablándole a la nada.', 'Ese hecho no le preocupó mucho. Era algo normal que su niño, al ser hijo único y no tener con quien jugar en la vecindad, imaginara un amigo. Solía pasar mucho entre los niños de tres a siete años. Esto mismo se lo explicó a su esposo. Tal y como venían los amigos imaginarios, se iban.', 'Lo cierto entonces fue que, a medida de que avanzaban los años, la niña no se fue. E incluso, Miguel la había bautizado como Alicia. Pero, fue gracias a que el tiempo pasaba, que Miguel empezó a cuestionarse si ella era algo real; pues ella no parecía envejecer.', 'Cuando finalmente cumplió dieciséis años, lo supo. Alicia no era una persona real, más eso no quitaba el hecho de que lo seguía a todas partes. Ahora, a donde fuera que él se encontrase, estaba ella. No le tenía miedo; Ella seguía sonriéndole siempre. No era algo a lo que debía temerle. Le había comentado de esto a su madre y ella le había sugerido que visitara un psicólogo. Pero a pesar de las constantes sesiones, Alicia no se iba.', 'Fue un día que, mientras la miraba jugar en el patio de su casa, se acercó a ella para hablar. A lo largo de los años aprendió que ella sólo asentía o negaba con la cabeza para comunicarse, pues nunca obtuvo una expresión verbal.', '―Alicia, ¿te gusta estar mucho conmigo? ―ella inmediatamente asintió sonriendo. ―¿Por eso no te has ido? ―la pequeña borró la sonrisa, reemplazándola por una expresión de tristeza. ―No es que me estorbes. Es sólo que, bueno, es un poco raro que yo tenga dieciséis años y siga viéndote.', 'Alicia lo tomó de la mano y volvió a sonreírle. Acto seguido empezó a jalarlo para ir fuera de la casa. Miguel entendió que era lo que ella quería; deseaba salir de aquel lugar y llevarlo quien sabe a dónde. Le extrañó eso por completo pero agradeció que ella no mostrara más esa expresión de vacío y tristeza. La siguió hacia un parque cerca de su casa. A ojos de las demás personas, él iba completamente solo.', '―¿Por qué hemos venido aquí? ―preguntó Miguel, para después ver como ella señalaba hacia el frente.', 'Allí, Miguel pudo observar a una chica de cabello rubio, quizá de la misma edad que él, que estaba sentada bajo un árbol, y, al parecer, Estaba dibujando. Lo siguiente que supo fue que su mano había sido nuevamente tomada por la niña que lo acompañaba, para jalarlo hacia la chica del árbol. Cuando estuvieron a poca distancia, Alicia le sonrió radiantemente. Y así, como apareció de la nada, se fue de la misma forma.', '―¿Puedo ayudarte en algo? ―preguntó entonces la chica rubia que lo miraba con curiosidad.', 'El muchacho miró el cuaderno de dibujos que yacía en las manos de aquella joven. ―¿Qué es lo que dibujas? mis padres son pintores, así que el arte me gusta mucho.', 'La chica sonrió al escuchar eso. Era la sonrisa más hermosa que Miguel había visto; y de hecho le resultó bastante familiar. Acto seguido, le enseñó todo su cuaderno de dibujo, pero hubo una obra que en especial le llamó la atención al joven. Era el dibujo de una niña, muy parecida a aquella pequeña con quien había jugado tantas veces a lo largo de su infancia. La chica, cuyo nombre era Sara, le había dicho que en múltiples ocasiones soñaba con aquella niña.', 'El tiempo fue pasando, creando buenos recuerdos para Miguel y Sara, quienes ahora vivían como marido y mujer en la casa de los padres de Miguel; dejada a él por herencia. Allí fue donde nació su pequeña niña, a quien decidieron llamar Alicia. Tenía el mismo cabello rubio de su madre, los mismos ojos verdes de su padre y una sonrisa encantadora.', 'Y entonces Miguel lo supo. Mientras veía su hija jugar canicas en el patio de su casa, sonriendo alegre y saltando de un lado a otro. La pequeña Alicia nunca fue un amigo imaginario o algo inexistente. Ella era real, siempre fue real. Formaba parte de él. Y, al igual que Sara, había conocido a su hija mucho antes de que ella siquiera naciera. Estaban destinados a estar juntos.', '\"Dear Diary,', 'Thank you for being such a patient listener. Today was just a regular day at the office. I got coffee, sat down and listened to Tom read the reports, did some light investigative work, and -oh yeah, killed a couple of drug dealers on my way home! You should have been there! It was a real rush! I would go into the details about the murder, but before I do, please remember, in case anyone is reading this without my permission-this is a work of fiction!', 'Now, on with the story-\"', 'The forty-something year-old man trembled as he twiddled the pen between his fingers. It was difficult to tell if he was really nervous or just overly excited.', '\"It was a dark and stormy night-I know that\\'s cliche, but that\\'s just how it is at night in Seattle! Jack Longmire-that\\'s me, if you don\\'t know!\"', 'Jack put his pen down and looked thoughtful for a few minutes.', '\"Where-oh-where was I? Oh yeah, Jack Longmire was on his way home after a long somewhat tedious and unfruitful-oh who was I kidding? It was downright boring! All I did was go through paperwork and listen to Tom yap yap like a little dog! I could have been working on the latest Black Death murder case, but oh no! Old Tom wanted to make sure we were thoroughly briefed on the details first. After all, there was no need to go rushing into things...or was there?\"', 'The pen started to swivel as Jack shivered in nervous manic glee.', '\"Anyway, to get back to my little story, I was bored, probably more bored than I had been in years-and I thought, I had just spent the last six hours learning about how to cover up a murder and commit the perfect crime-why put it to waste? Heh-ha! I bet you didn\\'t see that one coming. Well, you should have because it was in the introduction, but I digress...\"', '\"Meow!\"', 'The cat that lives in the office came up and started trying to rub affectionately against Jack. Without thinking, he put his hand out and started petting it, but before he knew it-', '\"Get off you mangy fur ball! I\\'m trying to tell a story here!\"', 'The cat sprawled itself out over his desk and purred contently.', 'Jack balled up a fist and yanked the cat up by the scruff of its neck.', '\"Meack!\" the cat screamed.', 'Just then-', '\"Jack, I need you to go take Tina and investigate that crime scene we were talking about!\"', '\"Finally, a little bit of action!\" Jack said under his breath.', '\"Mew!\" the cat said, almost in appreciation.', 'Jack sighed, loosened his grip, and gently placed the struggling feline on the floor. It quickly crept away, distrustful of the situation.', 'The forty-something aspiring crime fiction writer put his pen in his pocket, grabbed his coat, and walked to the car.', 'Tina was waiting. Jack eyed her, raised an eyebrow, and gave a wry smile.', '\"Are we doing some undercover work today or do you have another job you forgot to tell us about?\" Jack asked.', '\"Very funny, Jack, ha ha,\" Tina said dryly.', 'It was a fair question, at least Jack supposed it was. She was dressed kind of like a cocktail waitress, or at least he thought so. She had what looked like a leather corset and short shorts. Her short blonde hair fell into her face.', '\"Well, either that, or you need some serious fashion advice...\" Jack said with a smirk.', 'TIna sighed.', '\"If we\\'re going undercover we at least have to look the part. How well do you think a seedy joint like Montigo\\'s would receive us if we came dressed in our PI uniforms?\" Tina said.', '\"Well, probably better than if we showed up in our underwear, but I\\'m just a man, what do I know?\" Jack quipped.', '\"Apparently less than you look like you know...\" Tina quipped.', '\"Are we going to do this all the way to the club?\" Jack asked.', '\"Hey, you were the one who started it,\" Tina said.', 'Jack rolled his eyes and leaned back in his seat.', '\"Spoken like a true child,\" Jack whispered.', '\"Hey, what was that?\" Tina asked.', '\"Nothing...Lady Marmalade!\" Jack quipped again.', 'That time, he was rewarded for his cheekiness with a slap.', '\"I\\'m wearing this because Tom thought it was a good idea...\" Tina said.', 'Jack smiled and started giggling.', '\"...so maybe my boss isn\\'t afraid to mix business with pleasure after all?\" Jack asked.', '\"You let him hear you say that and he might just throw you off the force,\" Tina said.', '\"Tsk, tsk!\" Jack said. It was a clicking, scoffing sound.', 'Tina glared daggers at him.', '\"I\\'m just saying, I\\'m not the one dressed like a Playboy bunny; why couldn\\'t he have found a better outfit for me?\" Jack asked.', '\"Wanna trade?\" Tina asked.', 'The response was a chuckle.', 'Jack then raised his eyebrows and looked at Tina through the rear view mirror.', '\"You think I could pull it off?\" Jack asked.', '\"Yeah, when pigs fly!\" Tina said.', '\"...or when our boss starts taking these undercover missions seriously, right?\" Jack asked.', 'Jack continue driving, trying to hold back a chuckle. Young ambitious twenty-something Tina Bright could be such a child at times, and she was willing to do anything to make the force happy, including dressing like the Easter bunny and going to a cocktail party for a mob boss.', '\"If anyone\\'s dying tonight, it will probably be of laughter,\" Jack whispered to himself as he continued to drive.', \"He took one more long look at Tina and her ridiculous looking outfit. He didn't notice at first, but it actually had feathers, or at least it looked like it, maybe that was a hat she was wearing. Jack tried to stifle his laughter and not roast Tina anymore, but he almost felt like she was asking for it. Black lipstick, giant high heels, low-cut leather halter top...did he even need to go on?\", '\"I hope they don\\'t ask you how much you charge,\" Jack quipped. He just couldn\\'t help himself.', '\"Ooh! That does it. I\\'m changing when we get to the bar, but you better not cost us our mission!\" Tina said.', '\"Darn! and I was getting ready to see if I could nominate you for one of those makeover shows!\" Jack said.', '\"You know, you\\'re so hotheaded; you think you know everything...\" Tina yelped.', 'Jack sat and listened to her rant about him being an insensitive jerk. She must have had a lot to say, because by the time she was finished-', '\"..and we\\'re here!\" Jack said, as he turned in to the parking lot.', 'Tina and Jack got out and headed toward the door.', 'Jack took one last look at Tina and gave a whistle, followed by a dry chuckle. This earned him a glare from Tina.', '\"If you would open your eyes you\\'d see that I didn\\'t do half bad; most of the girls are dressed like this,\" Tina said.', 'The forty-something sighed when he realized she was right. Many of the women he saw walking in and out were dressed the same way Tina was, in those ridiculously short rompers that could have been bathing suits. In fact, compared to some of the girls he saw in the lineup, Tina was actually somewhat modest.', '\"They all need better fashion sense,\" Jack quipped.', '\"That\\'s besides the point, if I\\'m dressed like the majority of women at this place, I think I made the right call,\" Tina said.', '\"Speaking of call, the call girls called and they want that outfit back...\" Jack said.', 'Tina scoffed.', '\"..and I\\'m just about ready to call whoever sold you those clothes...and...\" Jack said.', 'Jack continued turned to scoff at Tina when he noticed she was already gone. He turned and saw she was already headed toward the door.', '\"I thought you said you were going to change?\" Jack said.', '\"Calm down, we\\'re not even inside yet. I can do it there. What? You don\\'t expect me to do it here, do you?\" Tina asked.', 'The older male sighed.', '\"No, even though that outfit leaves so little to the imagination already it probably wouldn\\'t even matter!\" Jack said.', '\"Yeah, but you ain\\'t the fashion police!\" Tina said.', '\"For that outfit, I\\'m happy to make a citizen\\'s arrest!\" Jack said.', 'Tina groaned and growled as they approached the line.', \"Jack was only kind of aware of what was going on. It was bad practice, but he couldn't help but let his mind wander back to the story he was writing. He took his pen out and started fiddling with it, anxious to put it to use.\", '\"Name please!\"', '\"I\\'m Rosie and this is Stephen!\" Tina declared in an obviously fake Brooklyn accent. Jack tried to hold back a giggle.', 'The man scanned the registry.', '\"I\\'m sorry; you ain\\'t on the list,\" the man said.', '\"There must be some kind of mistake, I\\'m, you see-\" Tina said.', 'Jack cut Tina off.', '\"I might be able to handle this,\" Jack said.', 'The forty something asked to see a copy of the register for himself, and they were indeed on the list.', '\"Next time, we\\'ll tell our managers if you refuse us service!\" Jack quipped.', '\"Right!\" Tina said.', 'The chilly air and even chillier mood hit them as they walked into the bar. The lights were dimmed, and the whole room was tinted in a sort of purple. Shadows played on the walls. Music from the speakers pounded their eardrums. Jack continued to fiddle with his pen.', '\"At least there are no flashing lights,\" Jack said, with a sigh.', \"Normally, he had trouble tolerating places like this. He wasn't about to let his twenty-something female co-worker show him up, though.\", '\"No matter,\" Jack said with a sigh.', 'The forty-something was perched on a bar stool. Lazily, he played with his straw while trying to figure out his next move. Tina was covering the hard part, and she was supposed to alert him if she found anything of interest.', \"Jack tapped his fingers nervously on the bar counter. He couldn't take it anymore; he was getting really bored, and it looked like business was slow tonight.\", 'Quietly, he pulled out his pen and began to write on a napkin.', '\"Well, I\\'m back. Hopefully, I wasn\\'t missed. It\\'s been dreadfully boring out here at this bar. It does remind me of what I did to those drug dealers, though, and, well, since I don\\'t have anything better to do right now, I might as well let you know every gory detail-okay-it all started on a night much like tonight-\"', 'The forty-something stopped, scowled at the paper, and then scratched through his first few sentences.', '\"Nah...I\\'ve already given them an introduction...but if I cut to the action now...won\\'t that leave a lot of plot twists and fun developments unexplored?\"', 'The man continued to fiddle with his pen and napkin.', '\"Like I said, I\\'ve decided to give you all of the gory details and not hold anything back-\"', 'Jack paused.', '\"Hmm...now, I kind of like the sound of that!\" the aspiring crime novel writer said.', 'Almost as if on compulsion, he went back and studied the sentence. He crossed out the last five words of the sentence he wrote.', 'Suddenly, a searing pain went through his head. It caused him to shake and drop his drink. He yelped as he held himself.', \"It was a tremor, and they weren't new. The forty-something hid them pretty well from his boss and coworkers, but they became more frequent with certain environmental triggers.\", 'Jack covered his ears to shield them from the loud music.', 'I have to get out of here. Jack thought.', 'The forty-something tried to make his way out of the jungle of flashing lights and pulsating music before he had another tremor. Finally, he made it out.', 'Just then, something like fireworks went off.', \"For a minute, he didn't recognize it, but then-\", 'No, those are gunshots? ', 'The forty-something led a pretty sheltered life, but he still should have recognized those.', 'Then, he heard a woman scream.', 'Tina? Jack thought.', \"Frozen, Jack continued to stare toward the club. He wasn't sure what to do. Briefly, he wished he was the character from his novel. That man wouldn't be afraid to take action, that man lived for danger, that man-\", '\"Hey, buddy, are you okay? It looks like you wet your pants!\" a burly man asked.', \"-wasn't him.\", 'Jack stared at his crotch, where the drink was spilled and gave a nervous laugh.', '\"Yeah...I had a bit too much to drink, I guess...\" he said sheepishly.', 'The man just stared at him. Jack started blushing when he realized what it sounded like he said. The', '\"It\\'s the drink...I spilled it...\" Jack tried to clarify.', '\"Oh? Do you need a ride home?\" the strangely friendly man asked.', '\"Uhm...no, thank you, though,\" the forty-something answered.', 'Jack breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the man leave. He may have been a forty-something single male, but he still had some dignity.', 'Relief was short lived. The police arrived, the tell-tale red and blue lights started flashing and casting shadows that made him uneasy.', \"He knew he had to hide; he had already had one tremor that night, and he wasn't in the mood to deal with another one.\", 'The two men stood quiet and close as they spoke. Their conversation on a topic that clearly had them worried. The children in their town kept going missing, and no one had an idea as to why.', '\"It\\'s almost like they\\'re vanishing from the park, schools, libraries, and even their own homes, or something.\" One of the men said. The second man looked to the first, and rolled his eyes.', '\"There\\'s no other way they could have just vanished. Especially right from where other could have seen them.\"', 'Eric couldn\\'t help but faceplam at the idea of anything supernatural. \"Oh come on. For all we know, they could have been lost, or even ran away for some reason. The second man looked to Eric. He was quiet, his worry clear.', '\"I hope you are right...\"']\n"
